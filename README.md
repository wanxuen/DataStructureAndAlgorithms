# DataStructureAndAlgorithms
In this assignment, we explore the performance and efficiency of various sorting algorithms, with focus on both comparison-based (Merge-Sort, Selection-Sort, Tim-Sort) and non-comparisonbased (Counting-Sort) algorithms. Our objective was to comprehensively analyse these algorithms by applying them to datasets of varying sizes and characteristics. We evaluated their behaviour across 11 experimental designs, including random data, sorted data, reversed data, datasets with repeated duplicate, negative data etc.Time complexity served as the primary metric for assessing computational efficiency, enabling a clear comparison of each algorithmâ€™s performance under different conditions. Additionally, we 
compiled detailed tables of result to compare the efficiency of the four algorithms across these scenarios, providing a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and limitations. This analysis highlights the computational strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, offering practical insights for real-world applications. By understanding their performance across different scenarios, we aim to guide the selection of the most suitable sorting techniques for specific data challenges, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of data processing tasks.
